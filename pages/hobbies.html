      <h1>A little bit of myself</h1>
      <p>
        As an expert engineer, I am passionate about a variety of hobbies that I
        believe can benefit not only my personal life but also my career. I find
        that these hobbies allow me to exercise my problem-solving skills, keep
        my mind sharp, and stay curious about the world around me. These hobbies
        include coding, spending time in green spaces, and learning about
        cars.<br />
        I believe that my hobbies are not just fun pastimes, but also important
        for my professional development as an engineer. I encourage recruiters
        to look for candidates who have diverse hobbies and interests, as I
        believe that this can be an indicator of a well-rounded individual who
        can bring a unique perspective to their work. In particular, I believe
        that hobbies like coding, spending time in green spaces, and learning
        about cars can provide engineers with valuable skills and experiences
        that can help them to excel in their careers.<br />

        For example, a candidate who is passionate about coding may have
        excellent problem-solving skills and be able to think systematically
        about complex issues. A candidate who spends time in green spaces may
        have better stress-management skills and be able to maintain a healthy
        work-life balance. A candidate who is passionate about cars may have a
        deep understanding of mechanics and be able to apply this knowledge to
        design and optimize complex systems.<br />
        I am passionate about a variety of hobbies, including coding, spending time in green
        spaces, and learning about cars. I believe that recruiters should look
        for candidates who have diverse interests, as this can be an indicator
        of a well-rounded individual who can bring a unique perspective to their
        work. By encouraging engineers to pursue their passions outside of work,
        we can help to create a more dynamic and innovative engineering
        community

        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <h4>Web developer</h4>
        <p>
          Coding will always be my passion. I need to experience all coding
          languages. Since I was a teenager, I've loved the challenge of writing
          code that can automate tasks or solve complex problems. I find that
          coding helps me to think logically and systematically, skills that are
          valuable not only in my work but also in my personal life.

        <h3>Green Spaces</h3>
        <h4>Forest Lover</h4>
        <p>
            In addition to coding, I am also passionate about spending time in green
            spaces. Whether it's hiking in the mountains or taking a walk through a
            local park, I find that being in nature helps me to clear my mind and
            reduce stress. I believe that spending time in green spaces is essential
            for maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

        <h3>Cars</h3>
        <h4>Speed & Mechanics</h4>
        <p>
        I have been a car enthusiast for as long as I can remember. I love learning about the mechanics of
        cars, how they work, and how they can be optimized for performance. I
        find that my love for cars has helped me to understand the principles of
        engineering better. I am fascinated by the way that engineers design
        cars to achieve specific performance goals, such as speed, fuel
        efficiency, and safety. I believe that my knowledge of cars has made me
        a more well-rounded engineer, as it has given me a deeper appreciation
        of the role that engineering plays in our daily lifes.
